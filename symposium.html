  	<h3>Multiphase Flows Symposium</h3>
    <br>
    <p class="body">The 5<sup>th</sup> International Conference on Fluid Flow, Heat and Mass Transfer (FFHMT'18) invites you to join the <strong>Multiphase Flows Symposium</strong>.</p>

    <p class="body">Multiphase flows found in a wide spectrum of engineering applications such as power generation, nuclear, oil production, water treatment, water desalination, refrigeration and air conditioning, carbon capture and sequestration as well as in processing equipment such as food, chemical processing, material handling and others. The Multiphase Flows Symposium, organized under the 5th International Conference of Fluid Flow, Heat and Mass Transfer (FFHMT'18), will be a forum of discussion of the industrial applications of multiphase flow technology for researchers and engineers working in different scientific and industrial sectors.</p>
    <p class="body"><strong>The symposium solicits contributions of abstracts, papers or posters that address themes and topics in the area of multiphase flow including but not limited to:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Multiphase flow simulation and experimentation</li>
      <li>Boiling and Condensation</li>
      <li>Bubble and drop dynamics</li>
      <li>Cavitation</li>
      <li>Interface phenomena</li>
      <li>Flow in porous media</li>
      <li>Fluidized beds</li>
      <li>Atomization</li>
    </ul>
