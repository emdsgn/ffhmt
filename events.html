      <h3>Workshop</h3>
      <p class="body">The 6<sup>th</sup> International Conference of Fluid Flow, Heat and Mass Transfer (FFHMT'19) invites you to propose a workshop.</p>

      <p class="body">The proposed workshop, if accepted, will be co-located with and under the umbrella of the conference.</p>

      <p class="body">Proposals by prospective chairs should be submitted to <a href="mailto:info@ffhmt.com" class="body-link">info@ffhmt.com</a> and will be evaluated by the Organizing and Scientific Committees.
