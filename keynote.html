  <p class="body">Pr. Désilets worked for 9 years in industrial R&D for Alcan International ltd, including 8 years at Arvida R&D Center at Jonquière, Canada and 1 year at the Laboratoire de Recherche des Fabrications (LRF) at Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne, France. He was in charge of new designs of low energy and high productivity industrial electrolysis cells. In 2006, he pursued his career in academia where he became a specialist in numerical modeling and industrial process optimization involving phase change, heat, mass and charge transfer phenomena in electrochemical systems. After 21 years of research, he developed a unique expertise in multi-physic modeling, advanced thermal diagnostic, parameter identification and energy efficiency. He is the author or co-author of more that 40 papers in peer-reviewed journals and of more than 30 conference proceedings.</p>

  <p class="body">Dr. Wael Ahmed is an associate professor at University of Guelph, Ontario, Canada. He is also the Associate Director for Research and External Partnership at the School of Engineering since 2017. He is working in the thermofluids area with particular interest in multiphase flow analysis of energy, water and food systems. He received his PhD in Mechanical Engineering from McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada in 2005. He has four years of industrial experience with Atomic of Energy of Canada Ltd. (AECL), and Nuclear Safety Solution (AMEC-NSS) providing technical consultation to several Canadian power generation plants (OPG, Hydro-Quebec, Bruce Power) in the area of multiphase flow and flow accelerated corrosion. </p>
	
   <p class="body">He is an expert in designing multiphase flow systems. His designs were primarily used in nuclear applications, oil and gas industry and recently in the food industry. He is also the founder and CTO of FloNergia Inc. which is commercializing both multiphase flow pumps and two-phase flow sensors for energy and food applications.  </p> 
   <p class="body">Dr. Ahmed is the author of two books in the area of flow accelerated corrosion, pumping machinery and multiphase flow, more than 70 articles appeared in reputable international journals and in conference proceedings, and more than 7 inventions.  </p>
