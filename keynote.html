  <p class="body">Prof. Aimy Bazylak earned a BEng in Engineering Physics from the University of Saskatchewan and a MASc in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Victoria, where she specialized in modelling microfluidic fuel cells. She then obtained her PhD in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Victoria where she specialized in multiphase flows in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells for clean energy. In 2008, Aimy joined the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering at the University of Toronto as an Assistant Professor. She is currently an Associate Professor and holds a Tier II Canada Research Chair in Thermofluidics for Clean Energy.  Since 2015 Aimy has served as the Director of the Institute for Sustainable Energy (ISE) at the University of Toronto.  </p>
