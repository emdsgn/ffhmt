  <p class="body">Brian Amsden obtained his PhD in Chemical Engineering in 1996, in the area of therapeutic protein delivery from hydrogels and polymer microspheres. Following his PhD, he worked for Angiotech Pharmaceuticals in Vancouver as a Research Associate, leading projects involving the formulation of paclitaxel for localized delivery. He left Angiotech to join the Faculty of Pharmacy at the University of Alberta, and is currently a Professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering at Queen’s University where he has been since July 2000. His current research interests include the development of biodegradable elastomers, hydrogels, and low viscosity hydrophobic polymers for the local delivery of small molecules, peptides and proteins, and stem cells, and as scaffolds for soft and connective tissue regeneration. He is the director of CREATE Connect Soft Connective Tissue Regeneration Network and a principal investigator in the CREATE Biointerfaces Network. He has received the Alberta Health Foundation for Medical Research Independent Establishment Award, the Ontario Premier’s Research Excellence Award, the Queen’s University Chancellor’s Research Award, and the Ontario Centres of Excellence Award of Excellence for Research Collaboration and Commercialization.</p>
