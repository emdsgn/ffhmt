  <p class="body">Prof. Aimy Bazylak earned a BEng in Engineering Physics from the University of Saskatchewan and a MASc in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Victoria, where she specialized in modelling microfluidic fuel cells. She then obtained her PhD in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Victoria where she specialized in multiphase flows in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells for clean energy. In 2008, Aimy joined the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering at the University of Toronto as an Assistant Professor. She is currently an Associate Professor and holds a Tier II Canada Research Chair in Thermofluidics for Clean Energy.  Since 2015 Aimy has served as the Director of the Institute for Sustainable Energy (ISE) at the University of Toronto.  </p>

  <p class="bold">Dr. Dana Grecov</p><img src="../img/Grecov.jpg" width="170" align="right" class="keynote-img">
  <p class="body">Dana Grecov received her B.Eng. degree in Mechanical Engineering from University Politehnica in Bucharest and her Ph.D. in Fluid Mechanics from Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble. After a postdoctoral research fellow position at McGill University Montreal, she joined the University of British Columbia in 2005 as an Assistant Professor. She is currently an Associate Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. </p>
  <p class="body">Her expertise is in biofluid mechanics, non-Newtonian fluid mechanics, rheology and mathematical modeling. She has 20 years of experience in complex fluids research, constitutive modeling development, and numerical simulations. She received the CFI (Canada Foundation for Innovation) Leaders Opportunity Award in 2007, a Peter Wall Early Career Scholar Award in 2007 and the NSERC (Natural Sci. & Eng. Res. Council) Discovery Accelerator Award in 2016. </p>
  <p class="body">She published over 100 conference and journal papers, many of which are in prestigious journals. Her published papers are the outcome of the combination of analytical or/and experimental with numerical simulations. She has chaired many sessions at international conferences and advised more than 40 graduate and undergraduate students. She has directed industry sponsored research and several NSERC funded research projects as Principal Investigator. Dr. Grecovâ€™s work has been highly interdisciplinary, involving collaborations with clinicians, but also chemical engineering, computer science, material science, physics.</p>
